  apps/medm needs write access from hpsrun (chmod a+w medm) so that saveFile.png
  can be written.  We will look at upated the code to make the temporary file in
  /tmp instead of the current working directory.

  Get purged list of required screens.
  Copy those external screens into appropiate areas of the hps tree.
