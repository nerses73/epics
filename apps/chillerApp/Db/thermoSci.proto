# This is the protocal file for RS-232.  For RS-485, set ADDR to "CC" and set 
# the address.
# 
# Notes:
#   Qualifier Byte (qb)
#   For the responses is hard-coded, not ignored.  The values were used to 
#   hard-code the ASLO and PREC fields for the various PVs.  See Table 3, 
#   page 51 of the manual for the details.
#
#   Checksums
#   Could have been hard-coded since only readbacks were done.  But they were 
#   included to show what's needed for control PVs, if they get added.
